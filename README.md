* AND, OR, PIPE, FG, BG:
	- left: [WSPACE] (STRING | CPAR)
	- right: [WSPACE] (STRING | REDIRECT | OPAR | if <FG, BG> ENDOFCMD)

* OPAR "(":
	- left: CMDBEGIN | [WSPACE] (AND | OR | PIPE | OPAR)
	- right: [WSPACE] (STRING | REDIRECT | OPAR)

* CPAR ")":
	- left: [WSPACE] (STRING | CPAR)
	- right: [WSPACE] (AND | OR | PIPE | CPAR | ENDOFCMD)

* REDIRECT:
	- right: [WSPACE] STRING

* PARENTHESES MATCHING AND QUOTING:
	- inside each pair parentheses sould not be an empthy command

```
<cmdline>	::= <block>
		| <block> (";" | "&") <cmdline>

<block>		::= <pipeline> {("&&" | "||") <pipeline>}

<pipeline>	::= <command> {"|" <command>}

<command>	::= <cmdlist>
		| "(" <cmdline> ")" <redir>	(* subshell *)

<cmdlist>	::= <redir>+			(* at least one redirect - without WORDs *)
		| <redir> {<arg> <redir>}+	(* at least one WORD - zero or more <redir> in any place *)

<redir>		::= {("<" | "<<" | ">" | ">>") <filename>}

<arg>		::= WORD

<filename>	::= WORD
